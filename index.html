          <h1>What the hack is it?</h1>
          <p>We're taking coders and designers, putting them together in a great space, serving up a hearty helping of tech-based challenges, and letting it all simmer together for a couple of days.</p>
          <p>The best part, it's all for charity. You'll be using your super powers for good &mdash; creating functional, usable tech solutions for organizations who work tirelessly to help others and make
          		the world a kinder place. What's better than that?</p>
          <p>On Friday, October 21, participants will form groups and be assigned to a charity to represent. After that, they'll review some challenge statements from the charity and select a problem
          		to tackle over the 40-hour hacking sprint.</p>

        <p>The advantage of a big, organized hackathon is five-fold:</p>
          <ul class="flagged">
            <li class="flagged">Coders and designers approach technology problems with fresh perspectives
            <li class="flagged">Prototyping is rapid and iterative
            <li class="flagged">A creative pressure-cooker environment is created, allowing everyone to feed off of the combined brain power and positive vibes
            <li class="flagged">A friendly atmosphere of competitive collaboration arises (it's for charity, but you can still kick butt)
            <li class="flagged">We're recruiting some amazing thinkers and innovators from the field to be judges
