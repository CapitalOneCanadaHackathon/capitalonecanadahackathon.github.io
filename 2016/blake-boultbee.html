		<h3>Information you’d like promoted to potential donors</h3>
		
		<p>Reaching out directly to prospective foundations and corporations.</p>
		
		<h3>Information you’d like communicated to at risk youths</h3>
		
		<p>How we work with the vulnerable members of our society, deal with the growing mental health needs of our young people, that we are unique in our mandate to work 
		with our clients, individuals and families, for indefinite periods "once a client, always a client, until the client says they're done"; how we address the growing 
		concerns around violence in our vulnerable communities.</p>
		<br />
		<p>That this is an amazing place to connect with a counsellor/therapist who will work with you for as long as you need to come in, be it 6 weeks, 6 months, or 6 years or....</p>
