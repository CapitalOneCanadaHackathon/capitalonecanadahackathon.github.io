		<h2 class="center">Challenges</h2>

		<h3>Challenge #1</h3>
		<p>Develop online tools that foster a collaborative learning environment for community financial coaches serving people with low incomes.</p>

		<h3>Challenge #2</h3>
		<p>Develop a tool using Prosper Canada’s financial literacy curriculum and resources to help people living on low incomes build their money management knowledge and skills.</p>

		<h3>Challenge #3</h3>
		<p>Use gamification to build activities into the daily lives of people living with low incomes that build their financial capability and wellbeing.</p>

		<h3>Challenge #4</h3>
		<p>Develop an online solution that enables people to easily search and find local financial empowerment programs and services, is interactive, visually appealing and easy to maintain and update.</p>

		<h2 class="center">Messages to Participants</h2>

		<h3>Challenge #1</h3>
		<p>Prosper Canada has developed and is piloting a variety of community financial coaching programs targeted at people with low incomes.  
		To prepare community financial coaches, we developed a coaching toolkit and training curriculum. Financial coaching is new to most of the community social services sector. 
		We are seeking ways to support a virtual community of practice that connects financial coaches across Canada and facilitates peer-to-peer knowledge sharing and access to 
		ongoing training, learning opportunities and new tools and resources.</p>

		<h3>Challenge #2</h3>
		<p>There are many budgeting tools freely available online but require a bank account to connect to them. These tools are not designed for people with low incomes, 
		and/or do not offer information and tips that have been developed and tested for effectiveness with low-income users. We are interested in developing a learning 
		tool that uses Prosper Canada's financial literacy curriculum module on budgeting and accompanying learning resources to enable individuals living with low incomes 
		to build their money management knowledge and skills.</p>
		
		<h3>Challenge #3</h3>
		<p>While people with low incomes have been shown to be better budgeters than most Canadians, they are less strong in other areas of financial capability like planning 
		ahead, saving, and obtaining accurate financial information and advice.  People with low incomes face financial barriers and challenges that people with middle and 
		higher incomes do not. These include difficulty getting banked, navigating financial products and services that are typically not designed to meet their needs, and 
		accessing neutral, relevant, accurate financial information and advice. Finally, their lack of income makes navigating everyday decisions and activities more demanding 
		and time consuming, making it harder for them to focus on financial matters or to think ahead and plan financially for the longer term. We are interested in seeing if 
		simple, enjoyable games purpose built for people with low incomes are one way we can help them build their financial capability.</p>
		
		<h3>Challenge #4</h3>
		<p>Prosper Canada created an interactive map of organizations providing financial education programs across Canada, but the tool was challenging to maintain and the data 
		has become outdated and corrupted. We are interested in building a tool that maps a broader array of non-profit, community-based and virtual financial empowerment 
		programs/services across Canada:</p>
		<br />
		<ul>
			<li>Financial education</li>
			<li>Financial coaching, counselling and problem-solving</li>
			<li>Help tax filing and accessing income benefits</li>
			<li>Help with basic banking</li>
			<li>Help opening RESPs and getting the Canada Learning Bond</li>
			<li>Help opening RDSPs</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Because we have limited resources, however, we’re interested in a tool that can pull data from the web to automatically populate and update the map, to minimize onerous 
		data collection and management costs. The goal would be to have a map that people with low incomes can search to identify programs in their community.</p>
