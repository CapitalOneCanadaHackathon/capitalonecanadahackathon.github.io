		<h2 class="center">Resource List</h2>

		<p>All data has been scrubbed all of the identifying information from these lists (name, email, phone #, etc.). Columns have been left for contact information 
		in files where it’s applicable, but have replaced the specifics with a ‘Yes’ where something is available and a ‘No’ where it isn’t.  In lieu of address 
		information we’ve used postal codes, so where a postal code appears we do have access to that constituent’s address, but where a ‘No’ appears we do not. 
		Also, please note that we have left in unique constituent id’s in all of the data sets and these are consistent across all of the files.</p>
		<br />
		<ol>
		<li><a href="/assets/files/1_Contact_Info_for_Current_Supporters.xlsx" target="_blank">Contact info for current supporters</a><br>
			For this individual, their postal code is listed, which means we have their address, we have their email address, their phone number, as well as permission to 
			email them. Using the provided ID, you can look up this constituent across all of the other data sets to follow.<br /><br />
		</li>
		<li><a href="/assets/files/2_Contact_info_for_e_news_subscribers.xlsx" target="_blank">Contact info for e-news subscribers</a><br>
			This is a full up-to-date list of our e-news subscribers.<br /><br />
		</li>
		<li><a href="/assets/files/3_Online_giving_process.pdf" target="_blank">Demonstration of current online donation process</a><br>
			This document outlines the current donation process. <br /><br />
		</li>
		<li><a href="/assets/files/4_Annual_Online_Donations.xlsx" target="_blank">Annual Online Donations</a><br>
			For the online gifts file we have included all individual gifts received online during our last two fiscal years (our fiscal year begins on September 1st). 
			Please note that we’ve excluded any gifts over $1,000 and any monthly pledges that are processed online – we solicit and treat these gifts differently and 
			they skew the online giving metrics pretty substantially. We have included both donation amounts and our campaign designations for each gift, but these 
			will probably require a bit of explanation from us during the hackathon.<br /><br />
		</li>
		<li><a href="/assets/files/5_hackathon_food_stats.zip" target="_blank">Food Collection &amp; Delivery Data</a><br>
			These files combine both pick-ups from food donors and deliveries to agencies, but they are both well labelled. We have also removed the identifying information 
			for all of these organizations but they all have their unique constituent id’s listed.<br /><br />
		</li>
		<li><a href="/assets/files/6_Survey_data.zip" target="_blank">Recipient Agency Survey Data</a><br>
			This is a full data dump of our annual agency survey. We have excluded the first 8 questions from the data because they all refer to specific identifying organizational  
			information. Please note that we currently conduct this survey through Survey Gizmo. We’ve also attached a pdf of all the questions just so you have them.<br /><br />
		</li>
		<li><a href="/assets/files/7_Chart_for_Sharing_Food_Donor_Information.xlsx" target="_blank">Chart for Sharing Food Donor/Pick-up Information</a><br>
			This chart includes all of the specifics that we require for a volunteer food pick-up. Right now this sheet is only used offline and it is filled in manually.<br /><br />
		</li>
		<li><a href="/assets/files/8_Raffle_Ticket_Samples.zip" target="_blank">Samples of Handwritten Raffle Tickets</a><br>
			The samples attached are scanned copies of historical raffle tickets 
		</li>
