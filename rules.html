					The Capital One "Gift the Code" Hackathon (the "<b>Hackathon</b>") is administered by Hackworks Inc. ("<b>Hackworks</b>") on behalf of Capital One Bank (Canada Branch) ("<b>Capital One</b>") (Hackworks and Capital One are referred to collectively herein as the "<b>Organizers</b>") for the benefit of participating non-profit organizations (each, a "<b>Charity</b>"). By participating in the Hackathon, participants (each, a "<b>Participant</b>", "<b>you</b>" and "<b>your</b>") confirm they have reviewed and agree to these Official Hackathon Rules and Regulations (the "<b>Rules</b>") and will abide by the decisions of the Organizers and the Hackathon staff. You also agree to comply with all applicable laws in your participation in the Hackathon.

					<li>
						<h3>PURPOSE:</h3>
						<p>
							The Hackathon is an opportunity for you to innovate, ideate, and rapidly prototype a creative technological solution to a unique challenge faced by a Canadian non-profit organization, all in open source. The Hackathon is a charitable event with no compensation or prizes of material monetary value, and is not a competition or a contest.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>ELIGIBILITY:</h3>
						<p>
							The Hackathon is open to all members of the public who are at least 18 years of age. All Participants must be legal residents of Canada, with the exception of employees or contractors of Capital One, its parent company, subsidiaries and affiliates, who must be residents of Canada or of the United States.
						</p>

						<p>
							The Organizers may at any time in their sole discretion disqualify any Participant who does not meet the Hackathon's eligibility criteria (including failure to provide evidence, to the satisfaction of the Organizers, of their meeting the eligibility criteria), fails to comply with these Rules or the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/code">Hackathon Code of Conduct</a>, or who attempts to disrupt the Hackathon in any manner.
						</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h3>HOW TO PARTICIPATE:</h3>
						<p>
							To participate, register for the Hackathon at <a href="www.giftthecode.ca">GiftTheCode.ca</a> (the "<b>Website</b>"). There is no fee for registration or participation.

In the event that any of the registered Participants advise the Organizers that they are not able to attend the Hackathon prior to the end of the Entry Period, their spot may be offered to individuals on the waitlist on a 'first come, first serve' basis.

You can only work on one Pod over the course of the Hackathon, and you can't trade, swap, or re-assign Pod members except with the permission of the Organizers. If you haven't formed your Pod in advance of the Hackathon, the Organizers may assign you to one based on your skills, experience, or other factors at the Organizers' sole discretion.

					<b>CODE OF CONDUCT</b>
					<br />
					Provided by: <a href="hackcodeofconduct.org">hackcodeofconduct.org</a>
				</p>

				<p>
					Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, or religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
				</p>

				<p>
					Photography is encouraged, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed. If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).
				</p>

				<p>
					Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.
				</p>

				<p>
					As this is a hackathon, we like to explicitly note that the hacks created at our hackathon are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy. Sponsors and partners are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Sponsor representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
				</p>

				<p>
					If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of hackathon staff immediately. Hackathon staff will be happy to help participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the hackathon. We value your attendance.
				</p>

				<p>
					If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the hackathon organisers may take any action they deem appropriate. This includes warning the offender, expulsion from the hackathon with no refund (if applicable), or reporting their behaviour to local law enforcement.
				</p>

				<p>
					We expect participants to follow these rules at hackathon and workshop venues and hackathon-related social events.
