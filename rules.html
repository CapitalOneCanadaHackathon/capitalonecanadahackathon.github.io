<p><strong>SIGN UP.</strong> Register for the Hackathon at <a href="giftthecode.ca" target="_blank">GiftTheCode.ca</a> from August 23rd, 2016 at 9am to 
October 20th, 2016 at 5pm, or when 150 people have registered, whichever comes first.</p><br /><br />

<p><strong>SHOW UP.</strong> Attend the Hackathon from 6pm on October 21st to 2:30pm on October 23rd, 2016 at BrainStation Toronto 
(460 King St. West., Toronto, ON, M5V 1L7, Canada) with your pod of 4 to 8 registered devs, coders, and other software geniuses. 
If you don’t have a pod in mind, don’t worry, we’ll match you up with one.</p><br /><br />

<p><strong>CODE IT.</strong> You’ll be assigned a deserving Canadian non-profit organization, and briefed on their unique challenge. 
Along with your pod, build your submission and solve your charity’s challenge. All pods start coding at the same time, and all code must be original.</p><br /><br />

<p><strong>GIFT IT.</strong> You and your pod own your submission and all rights to it – however, by participating you agree to make 
your submission open source under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0" target="_blank">Apache Open Source License 2.0</a>. 
There’s no prizes or compensation for participating, but we’ll be recognizing teams for their creativity, enthusiasm and sense of humor along the way.</p><br /><br />

<p><strong>BE KIND.</strong> The Hackathon is a safe space, and we ask you to comply with the <a href="/code/">Hackathon Code of Conduct</a> at all times. Harassment 
won’t be tolerated, so be nice, make new friends, and have fun!</p>
