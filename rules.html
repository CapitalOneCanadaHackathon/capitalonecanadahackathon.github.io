						</p>

						<p>
							The Organizers may at any time in their sole discretion disqualify any Participant who does not meet the Hackathon's eligibility criteria (including failure to provide evidence, to the satisfaction of the Organizers, of their meeting the eligibility criteria), fails to comply with these Rules or the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/code">Hackathon Code of Conduct</a>, or who attempts to disrupt the Hackathon in any manner.
