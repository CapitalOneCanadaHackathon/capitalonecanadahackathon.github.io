  bio: Professionally, my skill set lies in event management – but I am a huge tech enthusiast through and through. When able, I attempt to try every piece of technology I can get my hands on. I have experience developing and managing various large-scale databases. I love strategizing and developing strategic plans. Ultimately, everything I do at Capital One is client-facing, so I pride myself on my ability to work with and communicate with various personalities. I’m also a proficient gamer and am always up for learning a new video, board or card game!

    <h3>Create a solution that enables The 519 to manage its members.</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="content-accordion-body">
    The 519 serves thousands of people each year through its programs, space and services. As a community-minded organization, its goal is to ensure that each person is able to connect with the opportunities that will best help them in their journey. As such, it’s important to keep an accurate member profile of each person who engages with The 519 in order to share new information and resources with relevant persons as it becomes available. A member management solution will have a low-barrier  entry so new members are not overlooked, and will be easy to update and pull reports from.

    <h3>Create a user-friendly platform where event data can be captured and reported.</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="content-accordion-body">
    The 519 offers a valuable resource to many local community groups who are like-minded in serving the LGBTQ+ population. The event space available at The 519 is used for more than 360 events each year. Data of how the event space is used helps The 519 have a better understanding of the needs of the community, and also helps it report to its donor groups. This solution will provide The 519 staff and local community groups a seamless experience in capturing and sharing data from these events.

  </div>

  <p class="content-accordion-body">
    The number of programs, services, events and initiatives that The 519 facilitates means that valuable data is spread across many platforms. A single solution will allow these multiple data sets to be compiled so that accurate insights can be drawn to assess community needs and impacts.
