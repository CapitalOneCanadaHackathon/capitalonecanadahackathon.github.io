Gift The Code is taking place at [BrainStation](https://www.brainstation.io/) Toronto’s downtown location, an iconic historical building built in 1875 at Spadina and King. It is said that new ideas need old buildings, and the BrainStation redesign of the former Youth Hostel made sure to respect the original look and feel of the building while modernizing it to best represent its new mandate as a cutting-edge digital-technology education hub.  With brick walls, bright spaces and a great coffee shop, BrainStation is inviting and inspiring; the perfect venue for a hackathon!
<br />
<br />
Daniel Eidan, General Manager at BrainStation, celebrates BrainStation’s participation as the official location partner of Gift The Code by declaring that, "BrainStation is committed to equip the next generation of digital leaders and creators with the skills necessary to solve meaningful problems using technology. As such, BrainStation is proud to host Gift the Code and help improve digital literacy in the non-for-profit and charity sectors."
<br />
<br />
BrainStation was founded in 2012 as the answer to an all industry encompassing need for new forms of tech education to keep up with the disruptive and exponential pace of technological innovation over the last two decades. The lack of digital workers capable of filling the positions required for those developments was what drove the collective of industry practitioners to launch BrainStation and provide collaborative, hands-on training for working professionals, freelancers and entrepreneurs who could fill those positions.

<br />
Similar to how BrainStation has set out to up-skill the next generations of creators, Capital One Canada’s Gift the Code has set out to upgrade the digital capabilities of its participating charities.

<br />
As the world becomes increasingly digital, it is essential for organizations like Gift the Code’s participating charities to adapt and adopt the use of technology to provide their services, better communicate internally and externally, and connect with people on their digital devices. Organizations like BrainStation and Capital One’s Gift The Code Hackathon are two great examples of what is being done to help society transition to digital technologies in a more seamless and productive manner.
