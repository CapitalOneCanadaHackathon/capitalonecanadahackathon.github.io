We asked our Capital One Charity Champions why they chose to be part of Gift the Code and here’s what they had to say:

<br />

## Kids Help Phone

### Ian Whitestone

Last year, I was lucky to be a participant in Gift the Code on one of the teams. It was my first experience in any hackathon. Pulling together a solution in one weekend was an incredibly rewarding experience – and the constant supply of great food didn’t hurt! I am excited to participate in a greater capacity this year and work directly with Kids Help Phone leading up to and throughout the event.

### Aaron Murray

I am participating in Gift the Code because I have seen the impact that highly skilled work can have on non-profits. With skills ranging from consulting to working in software, alongside my passion to increase the impact of non-profits, it made sense to volunteer for Gift the Code. I also love the thought of helping build something that can solve a tough problem or unlock a new opportunity for a deserving organization in a weekend!

### Warren Duffy

I’ve always been proud of Capital One’s commitment to supporting Canadian charities, and the Gift the Code hackathon is a supercharged way to quickly make a meaningful difference. I have been a member of The 519 since I moved to Toronto and have always been impressed with its ability to adapt to the changing needs of the LGBTQ+ community. I’m very eager to see what will come from this year’s event and I know it will be impactful for everyone involved.

### Allan Tota

I am participating in Gift the Code because not only does it represent everything I believe in (philanthropy and technology) but it is a shining example of how Capital One lives its mission to be accessible to all. As a professional event planner, it also speaks to my passion for event management and participation. I believe this particular event is something desperately needed by the community, and the organizations supported by this initiative are all phenomenal in what they do on the ground. I am honoured to be able to, in small part, support this fantastic event alongside a group of amazing people. Witnessing the absolutely amazing work that the participants produce in such a short time is nothing short of miraculous.

When I heard that Gift the Code would be an opportunity to work with amazing charities and support incredibly creative and talented participants, I couldn’t say anything other than “sign me up!”

I am excited to connect with the Toronto tech community and collaborate on an initiative that will use technical skills for a good cause. The opportunity to create digital solutions for challenges that charities are facing is exciting and I can’t wait to get started!

I am participating in Gift the Code to experience the intersection of two things I love – Capital One and volunteering. I am excited to be in an environment with like-minded people trying to solve problems for a meaningful cause.

Gift the Code is an amazing opportunity to apply my skills and knowledge to worthy charities and their causes. I am particularly excited about working with Indspire and the other participants to guide the development and implementation of unique, open-source solutions that help Indigenous youth across Canada.

I am participating in Gift the Code because I want to help amplify the work of the charity partners.

### Jean Stewart

The work that charities do to make a positive impact in their community is inspiring. Any opportunity I have to gain a better understanding of the challenges that they face from an organizational perspective – whether they are barriers to scaling, implementing tech or simply improving internal communications – is an opportunity to use my time and skills for something good.

### Mahtab Sabet

I participated in Gift the Code last year and helped build one of the solutions. I had a blast and was able to see how impactful the solution was for the charity. The opportunity to use my expertise do something so significant with such a positive impact was a great way to spend a weekend, and I’m excited to do it again!
