<h3 class="charity-anchored-title anchored-title">About</h3>
More than just a telephone number, Kids Help Phone is a national community working tirelessly to support young people with the issues that are most relevant to them. Its mission is to improve the well-being of children and youth in Canada by providing them with anonymous and confidential professional counselling, referrals and information in English and French through technologically based communications media.
<br />
<br />
Since 1989, Kids Help Phone has been pioneering response solutions to ensure that young people in Canada are supported in moments of crisis. As technology continues to push the boundaries of digital communications, Kids Help Phone faces increasing pressure to stay accessible while still ensuring that the most effective communication channels are maintained. Since 2010, Kids Help Phone telephone counselling has increased by 127% – indicating that many young people still want to hear a voice at the other end of the line.

Gift the Code will help Kids Help Phone continue to adapt to the changing tech environment in Canada and help the organization demonstrate its impact to prospective donors.

    <h3>04 Create a solution that diversifies and increases the number of donors (effectively decreasing their barrier to entry).</h3>
  </div>

  <p class="content-accordion-body">
    Why?
    <br />
    <br />
    Kids Help Phone has a faithful donor base but in order to increase the resilience of its funding and ensure that programs and services are not put at risk, it needs access to donors in new markets. A solution that allows Kids Help Phone to increase the number of donors will impact the long-term vision that Kids Help Phone can imagine and thus make a reality for young people in Canada.
