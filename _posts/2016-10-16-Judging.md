Gift the Code is merely a few days away! By now, some of you will have thought about your game plan, while others are waiting to get there before doing so.
Some of you will already have teams and others will form them over dinner at kick-off. Whatever your decision, it really doesn’t matter either way because
you’ll all have fun using your creativity, experience and problem-solving skills to tackle the challenges put forth by the charity randomly assigned to your team.

<br />
That being said, it would probably help to know how your submission is going to be judged at Gift the Code. Here’s a breakdown of information that will
help get you and your team prepared:
<br />
<br />
<h3>Teams</h3> Each team will consist of 4 to 6 participants. Teams can be formed beforehand or on the Friday night of the hackathon. We’ll be there to help.
<br />
<h3>Charity challenges</h3> A lottery will assign teams to the different charities. All of the charities are providing 4 or 5 diverse challenges for teams to choose from.
<br />
<h3>Judging Format</h3> The judging will take place in a science fair-like expo, where teams will give presentations to a set of rotating judges – each of whom is assigned
to award badges based on certain criteria.
<br />
<h3>Award Badges</h3> Your team’s objective will be to design a solution that fulfills the requirements of eight different criteria. Teams will be awarded a badge for each
criterion their solution meets. Judges will each be assigned a badge for a specific criterion to hand out to the teams that meet the necessary badge requirements.  

<h2>Criteria</h2>

<h3>Problem Solver</h3> Effectively addresses one of the challenges of the assigned charity.
<br />
<h3>Impact</h3> The solution will have an immediate and positive impact on the charity.
<br />
<h3>Implementation</h3> The solution can be implemented by the charity with minimal effort.
<br />
<h3>Functionality</h3> The prototype of the solution works and functions as intended.
<br />
<h3>Pitch Perfect</h3> The pitch of the solution conveyed the problem, solution and feasibility.
<br />
<h3>Design</h3> The design of the solution was well thought out, accessible, attractive and user friendly.
<br />
<h3>Innovation</h3> The team has identified a unique and creative way to solve the problem.
<br />
<h3>Pushing Tech</h3> The team uses new technology (software and/or hardware) to solve the problem.
