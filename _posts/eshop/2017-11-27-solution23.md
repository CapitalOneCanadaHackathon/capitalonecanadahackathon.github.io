description: 519 Rainbow Road is an integrated, all-in-one platform that combines member, donation and event data to produce easy-to-understand charts and metrics. The user only needs to upload a formatted Excel spreadsheet to get started. The platform uses various Python scripts to clean up and combine member, event, and donation data produced inExcel  into a Postgres database. The data is then transformed into graphs, heat maps, word clouds, etc. using D3 and Flask to provide an end-to-end solution.
