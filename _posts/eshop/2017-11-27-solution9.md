description: A Javascript-enabled widget that motivates visitors to donate to Autism Ontario. The widget creates a hover effect with specified denomination amounts that make it simple for users to donate. The hover effect encourages donations in a non-intrusive way by showing users the words “support” or “donation” consistently when users hover over images.
