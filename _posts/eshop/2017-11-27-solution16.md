description: This tool helps to match students with bursaries by displaying a list of eligible students for each bursary and a list of eligible bursaries for each student. The tool can be adapted for other processes that require filtration of a list based on criteria outlined in another file. The current process relies on the fact that the student profile and bursary requirements will have the same header/requirement name and compares the content in each.
