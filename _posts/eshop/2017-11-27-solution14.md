description: This web app supports keeping in touch with CEE program alumni on social media. It provides a directory of all CEE program alumni, along with links to their various social media accounts, and presents the information according to how recently a staff member has reviewed their posts. When staff members mark alumni as 'reviewed', the app updates the alumniâ€™s next review date to the next month. The app consists of a web interface, which could be password protected, and a Google sheet for entering and editing alumni contact info.
