description: AssessmentBot is a chatbot designed to help Kids Help Phone quickly and effectively assess counsellor performance. AssessmentBot simulates a counselling session with a youth in need using multiple choice questions whose answers are each weighted. At the end of the session, the counsellor is shown a graph of how they scored. The bot gives counsellors tips for improvements in low scoring areas.
