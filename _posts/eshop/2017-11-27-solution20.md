description: This solution provides a  user-friendly interface for volunteers to keep track of donation inventory. Users can add, edit, and remove donation items from inventory and label each itemâ€™s demand level. Inventory can also be searched and viewed by item category. A records page tracks and displays all changes made to the inventory. This page also displays monthly averages for each priority state. A public donation page displays required items in order of demand level so donors can more clearly see which items are in highest demand.
