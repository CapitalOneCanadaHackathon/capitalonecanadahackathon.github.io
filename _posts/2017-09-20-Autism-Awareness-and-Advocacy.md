Autism Ontario’s vision is clear: acceptance and opportunities for all individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder. You have likely met someone who has Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), but like most people, you may only have a cursory understanding of the challenges they – and their families – face.

There are currently 135,000 individuals living with ASD in Ontario, and 1 in 94 children living with ASD globally.<sup>1</sup> Autism Ontario works relentlessly to ensure that individuals with ASD are provided the means to achieve quality of life as respected members of society. Historically, this has meant working with the families of children with ASD, since parents often reach out to Autism Ontario shortly after their child is diagnosed. But the success of its programs has resulted in a growing community of teens and adults with ASD who have vastly different needs than young children.

To serve this large audience, Autism Ontario works through 25 chapters across the province. The chapters foster relationships built on trust and mutual respect throughout the autism community, while also providing expertise, guidance and services. By facilitating programs that address a broad list of resources and needs, Autism Ontario is able to reach thousands of individuals with ASD, create strong communities and promote happy and healthy lives.

As the leading source of ASD information online, many families, and more recently, individuals with ASD, turn to Autism Ontario for support and information. Through awareness and advocacy, Autism Ontario aims to make resources more accessible to those who need them.

Gift the Code participants, in collaboration with Autism Ontario, can use technology to streamline events, facilitate communication among chapters, promote engagement and inform its large audience. Jeff Bomben, the Communications Coordinator at Autism Ontario, explains that the ideal digital solutions “must be flexible and responsive to meet the growing needs of our community. We want to make it as easy as possible for anyone to find what they are looking for and to connect with us.”

Your contributions can greatly affect Autism Ontario’s reach and help it utilize digital tools to make its services more accessible. By joining Gift the Code, you’ll have the opportunity to think, code, create and present solutions that will help people on the autism spectrum and their families. Give back, with your unique perspective, skills and talents – your participation could provide the gift of code to Autism Ontario! [Register here](https://www.hackworks.com/gtc17)!
