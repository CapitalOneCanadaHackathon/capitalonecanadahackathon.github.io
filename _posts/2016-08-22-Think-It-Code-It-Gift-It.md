Welcome to Gift the Code, a hackathon from Capital One that will help advance the cause of six local charities by giving them a technology boost!
<br/>

Driven by the desire to commit as much funding as possible toward their respective causes, local charity organizations often operate on tight budgets and rarely have access to top-tier technology talent.
This prevents them from taking full advantage of digital solutions that are already available. By bringing your skills, talents and unique perspective to Gift the Code, you can change this and
help give participating organizations a much-needed boost.

<br/>
On the weekend of October 21 to 23, join over 100 other participants who are passionate about technology and innovation at BrainStation’s beautiful King and Spadina location.
You’ll work together to develop solutions that help:
<br/>

•	Improve the lives of kids with disabilities;
<br/>
•	Support individuals in the LGBTQ community, so they can create and maintain healthy relationships with their families;
<br/>
•	Reduce food waste and feed the hungry;
<br/>
•	Provide at-risk youth with counselling, training and programming;
<br/>
•	Fight financial illiteracy and poverty; and
<br/>
•	Assist women and children suffering from domestic abuse
<br/>

Fighting for different causes and providing services to diverse target groups requires creative solutions and the use of relevant technologies. What better way to make an impact on your community than by joining forces with Gift the Code and sharing your time and creativity for a good cause?
