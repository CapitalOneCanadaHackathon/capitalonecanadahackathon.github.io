As the Toronto tech community buzzes with the topic of diversity, there has never been a better time to collaborate on solutions to reach marginalized communities.

Innovation is driving change in sectors spanning finance, health and business, with technologists pursuing the most transformative solutions to disrupt established industries. Around the world, entrepreneurs are applying their lenses not just to industry challenges but to issues of social interest. At home in Toronto, you would not be hard-pressed to find organizations that would benefit from the efficiencies of technology.

At Capital One, that is exactly what we have done. With a mission to make a meaningful contribution to some of the most vulnerable communities in Toronto, we want to give the gift of code.

For the second year in a row, we’re kicking off Gift the Code – a hackathon that will bring together some of the most ambitious thinkers, avid technologists and creative data scientists to solve the biggest digital challenges local charities are facing. If our first hackathon taught us anything, it was that when forward-thinking leaders come together to give back, extraordinary results transpire!

Gift the Code is not for the faint of heart. The challenges the charities face are complex and involved. Although they serve different populations, there are common barriers among their experiences. The digital solutions that will be designed will increase the impact of each charity exponentially, effectively strengthening the diversity of our city.

The charity partners for 2017 are:

[Autism Ontario](http://www.autismontario.com/) - The leading source of information on Autism in Ontario and one of the largest collective voices representing the autism community in Canada.

[The CEE Centre for Black Professionals](http://www.ceetoronto.com/) – An organization dedicated to addressing economic issues affecting Black youth in Toronto.

[Indspire](http://indspire.ca/) – An Indigenous-led charity committed to empowering Indigenous communities in Canada by providing access to education for Indigenous students.  

[Kids Help Phone](https://kidshelpphone.ca/) – The only 24/7 counselling and information service for young people in Canada.

[Sistering](http://www.sistering.org/) – A women’s organization that offers practical and emotional support through programs that enable women to take greater control over their lives.

[The 519](http://www.the519.org/) – A City of Toronto agency and registered charity committed to the health, happiness and full participation of the LGBTQ+ community.

From November 3 to 5, 2017, bring your passion for technology and your ambition to make the world a better place, and build meaningful solutions alongside other teams. You’ll be part of a transformative group of 150 leaders gathering at Ryerson’s Mattamy Athletic Centre to harness collective energy and channel it into changing the world. Fuelled by a vibrant atmosphere and awesome food, this will be a hackathon to remember.
